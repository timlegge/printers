Default Printer Change Tray Icon Utility for Windows

## History

Printers was written in the days of Windows 95 and was written to allow the efficient changing of the default printer so that Acess 2.0 would recognize that the printer changed to Adobe Acrobat and allow going back and forth.

## License

Printers was originally licensed under the terms of the GPL 2.0+.  As I no longer use the utility I am relicensing it as a duo license MIT and  GPL-2.0-or-later.

To be clear you may use the code under the terms of either license.  I hope you choose to release the code should you choose MIT but if I cared too much about that I would work on it myself.
